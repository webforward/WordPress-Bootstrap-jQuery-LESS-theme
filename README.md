WordPress Starter Bootstrap jQuery SCSS Theme
---------------------------------------------

Clean and lightweight starter theme based on Bootstrap 5, jQuery 3, SCSS, Turbo and incorporates loads of functions 
ready to be turned on and off in the functions.php file.

This theme strips WordPress back, removes all the bloat and leaves you with a clean html response, a favicon, a single 
css resource in the head and a single js resource in the footer. Four requests in total.

Some features within this theme may not be laid out the way you like to work, but feel free to customise it. I developed 
this theme for ourselves and to streamline getting started on a new bespoke theme for a project.

The JS and SCSS within this theme are compiled using Vite from the /src folder to the /build folder. A good 
understanding of npm and composer is required to use this theme.

Feel free to submit pull requests of any improvements you can make; and if you find this theme useful, please 
[buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mrl22).

Installation & Run
------------------

### Development
```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
You can also run `npm run watch` this will create a temporary file at `build/vite-dev-server.json` which should be 
temporarily uploaded to the server. This will tell Vite-for-WP to load resources from http://localhost:5173/ for 
real-time changes. Note that only you will be able to see these updates.

### Useful Files

Files from `src` will be compiled in to `build` using Vite. If you wish to retain ownership of the source code, you 
should not upload or give your client access or access to the `src` folder. 

* `src/theme.js` - Theme JavaScript File.
* `src/scss/_variables.scss` - Bootstrap Customisation & Other Useful Variables.
* `src/scss/style.scss` - Theme Styles File.
* `src/assets/` - use this folder for any assets, these will be compiled in to `build/assets/`.

### Live Server
```
$ composer install
```
Make sure your compiled `build` folder is uploaded.
